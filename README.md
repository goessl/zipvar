# zipvar

The awkward middle child between `zip` and `zip_longest`.
Not short. Not long. Just right.
```python
>>> from zipvar import zip_var
>>> a = (1, 2, 3)
>>> b = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
>>> c = set()
>>> for x in zip_var(a, b, c):
...     print(x)
...
(1, 4)
(2, 5)
(3, 6)
(7,)
(8,)
```

## Installation

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/zipvar.git
```

## Usage

One module `zipvar` with a single class `zipvar`.

- `zip_var(*iterators)`: Return a `zip_var` object whose `.__next__()` method
returns tuples containing one element from each of the given iterables. The
order of elements in each tuple always matches the order of the input
iterables. Iteration continues until all iterables are exhausted, then a
StopIteration is raised. Once an iterable is exhausted, it is excluded from
the resulting tuples - they become shorter over time.
